# Deluge.SR.nzbToMedia.Launcher
Event based MS Windows script, which does : own window hiding, failed download agent, crap cleaner, completeness &amp; quality checker, E-AC3 converter, partial MEDE8ER meta-data manager, pre-post processor, post-process launcher of nzbToMedia started by Deluge's limited, standard Execution-plugin, to -finally- be integrated in my local area network based, SickRage tvseries-collection, residing on a LAN NAS-device. On the side TRAKT's online database of my collection is kept up to date, including management of watched tvseries-pilot's, which don't make it into a tvseries I will actually follow from that point on.
