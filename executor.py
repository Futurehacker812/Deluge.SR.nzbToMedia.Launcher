#  STEPS TO TAKE :
#  Run As (Dictated by Deluge) :
#      executor.py "d2d6a72b60cdb2cc5e80d3277d89d5df18c3ecbc" "Name.S01E01.720p.WEBRip.H264-GRP" \
#                  "D:\TorrentDL\u.series"
#  Check if PARAM 2 is file or directory :
#      D:\TorrentDL\u.series\Name.S01E01.720p.WEBRip.H264-GRP(.mkv) ??
#          -> note : Extremely basic but therefor easy to overlook check!
#             Initiating torrent downloads by scripts using magnet-links, sometimes prevents you
#             from noticing the movie/serie-episode download is not in a folder of it's own.
#             Usually this is standard practice. Is there just one single file not in a folder ?
#             This of course has consequences when trying to tidy/clean the release from as much
#             unnecessary extra files and even worse (malware/virus).
#             Imagine not checking : chdir to a file instead of folder - script will not halt, but
#             no directory change was made. Still in script directory the script starts cleaning.
#             You could lose all your scripts / other files, or at least spending time restoring
#             a backup. Prevent extra work.- automation is the goal : not extra work!
#  Clean Folder after handling possible exception, based on experience :
#      D:\TorrentDL\u.series\Name.S01E01.720p.WEBRip.H264-GRP
#          Filemasks which are being deleted for movies / serie-episodes :
#              - *.links    - *.nfo    - *.bat
#              - *.exe      - *.chm    - *.cmd
#              - *.nzb      - *.par    - *.vbs
#              - *.par2     - *.sfv    - *.ps1
#              - *.srr      - *.jpg    - *.js
#              - *.png      - *.bmp    - *.py
#              - *.ico      - *.txt    - *.[docx|xlsx|pptx]
#              - *.[1..99]  - *.OSX (and OSX typical files)
#              - RARBG.*    - *.(thumbs db)
#              - *.pdf      - Goedkoop*.rar
#              (and so on.. edit list for personal preference / need)
#          Comparable to what is often done with a batchfile function under Windows (example) :
#          >> FOR %%g IN ( *.nzb *.par2 *.par *.sfv *.srr *.jpg *.gif *.png *.txt *.nfo *.url \
#          >>              Q-for-You.* *.exe *.chm *._Contents *.plist *.wflow *.workflow RARBG.* \
#          >>              Goedkoop*.rar ) DO ( DEL "%%g" )
#  Check videocontainer's first audiostream :
#      If not produced as E-AC3 stream, then continue to the next step.
#      If it IS E-AC3 instead of the standard A-AC3 codec, then perform in the background :
#          - rename container to *.eac3.mkv
#          - using FFMpeg leave videostream & subtitlestreams untouched
#          - just reencode audiostream from E-AC3 into A-AC3 and recombine this stream, with the
#            untouched video & subtitles. This saves A LOT time compared to transcode or full
#            reencode (as nzbToMedia (see next step) performs.
#          - when starting the FFMpeg execution, also start a monitor on FFMpeg's ProcessID :
#            on end of ProcessID delete *.eac3.mkv. This ensures removal of correct input, when
#            multiple postprocessing threads run ( multiprocessing + nonblocking code ).
#          - After deleting the file continue to the next step
#  Continue postprocessing using nzbToMedia's scripts :
#      Calling nzbToMedia gives additional perk of FDH (failed download handling), when being
#      coupled to SickRage as main serie-episodes management centre. The proliferation of fakes,
#      incompletes, corrupt files, codec scams, propagation issues, upload glitches and
#      DMCA takedowns can break the automation process and requires user intervention.
#      Not what we want.. we want full automation, with no waiting time!
#      >> ISSUE : pyw TorrentToMedia.py "193593c6678281cc3fd2b4e23232747c4855820f" \
#                                       "Name.S01E01.720p.WEBRip.H264-GRP" "D:\TorrentDL\u.series"
#      End-of-Script!
#  IMPORTANT: path-notation under Windows sometimes changes :
#                 * usually pathnotation under Windows   :  "D:\etc"
#                 * occasionally pathnotation found like :  "\\?\D:\etc"
#             Make sure both forms are dealt with correctly! Easy string replace would do the
#             trick (from Windows batch script as example) :
#                 ' SET resultdir=%~3\%~2 ' and then ' SET resultdir=%resultdir:\\?\=% '
